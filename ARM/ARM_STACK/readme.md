# The system ticker is represented by exti, and this code simulates how to run several jobs quickly, much like an operating system.


## at first system will run in main_os stack then interrupt will happen and take it to psp(process stack pointer) and excute task a then interrupt will happen again then will go to task b and so on.


## First, set the processor to run in non-privilege mode and set the PSP reg to equal the task address.

![set psp reg = _s_psp_A](https://github.com/mohamedayman130/Mastering-Embedded-System/assets/117905345/3aec514f-791e-4f9a-a3b7-ec9da50f6f44)


## Make sp point to psp as the next step.

## Third step: an externalÂ interrupt will occur following task execution, putting the processor in privilege mode so it can write to registers.

## Make a sp point to msp as the fourth step.
