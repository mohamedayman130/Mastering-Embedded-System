# The system ticker is represented by exti, and this code simulates how to run several jobs quickly, much like an operating system. 
# at first system will run in main_os stack then interrupt will happen and take it to psp(process stack pointer) and excute task a then interrupt will happen again then will go to task b and so on.

## First, set the processor to run in non-privilege mode and set the PSP reg to equal the task address.

## Make sp point to psp as the next step.

## Third step: an externalÂ interrupt will occur following task execution, putting the processor in privilege mode so it can write to registers.

## Make a sp point to msp as the fourth step.
